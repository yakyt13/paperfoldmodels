Current algorithm unfold model, but if it has overlaps algorithm will cut unfolded models into
segments with no overlapping

Need TO_DO:
1) Try to improve algorithm or maybe make new one that unfold model as one solid piece
2) Test it on some models
3) Find some extreme cases to test algorithm
4) Optimize algorithm. heavy models require alot of run time. need to reduce complexity of algorithm
